  <p>This is a project based on many types of <b>figurative language</b>, <b>examples</b> from the text, and <b>connections</b> to the text, “Esperanza Rising”. The prompt was to create a visual explaining different types of figurative language, (Foreshadowing, Imagery, Metaphor, Personification, Simile, and Symbolism) and to give examples from the text, (Esperanza Rising). I coded a website from scratch to present this project. I hope you like it! </p>

<div id="figurative language"><h1>Figurative Language</h1></div>
<div id="forshadowing"><h2>Foreshadowing</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p><b>Foreshadowing</b> is a type of <b>figurative language</b> that authors use to <b>build suspense</b> and <b>tension</b> for <b>what will happen next</b>. It is also a tool writers use to <b>give hints</b> at what will come later in their story/what events are <b>too come</b>. </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>"When we arrived, nothing was as promised. There were many hard times. But life was also exciting" (<i>Pg. 49</i>) This is <b>foreshadowing</b> because it shows how Abuela has immigrated before and it seems to relate her experiences to Esperanza’s possible experiences. </p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p>Sometimes if someone/you are being <b>negative</b>, you might foreshadow what will happen/what will happen to you. Also, people could foreshadow that stocks could crash and the next day <b>they do</b>. <b>Foreshadowing</b> is everywhere in real life! </p>
<div id="imagery"><h2>Imagery</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p><b>Imagery</b> is a type of <b>figurative language</b> that uses extreme <b>detail</b>, the five <b>senses</b>, and <b>evokes mental images</b> of different <b>scenes</b>, (<i>see examples</i>). </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>“The field was still surrounded by the chain-link fence, but no one was protecting the entrance 211 this time. All the evidence of people she had seen before was there, but not one person was to be seen. Laundry waved on the clothesline. Plates with rice and beans sat on crates and swarmed with busy flies. Shoes were lined up in front of tents, as if waiting for someone to step into them. The breeze picked up loose newspapers and floated them across the field. It was quiet and desolate, except for the goat still tied to the tree, bleating for freedom.” (<i>Pg. 211-212</i>) 
  <div></div>
  This is <b>imagery</b> because it describes a scene completely, with extreme detail, that evokes a mental image and uses senses. </p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p><b>Imagery</b> is used all the time in real life! Whether you’re describing what happened in your day, or your favorite food, you’re using imagery! Any time you describe something in detail or describe something using one/multiple senses, its imagery.</p>
<div id="metaphor"><h2>Metaphor</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>A <b>metaphor</b> is a type of <b>figurative language</b> based on making <b>connections</b> between multiple/two things/ideas. Metaphors <b>don’t use</b> comparison words, (<i>like, as, etc.</i>) they just state things <b>implicitly</b>. Metaphors are like <b>similes</b>, but similes use <b>comparison words</b> while metaphors don’t. </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>“After you have lived many mountains and valleys, we will be together.”  (Pg. 51) 
    <div></div>
    This is a <b>metaphor</b> because it relates life to “mountains and valleys,” implicitly and without comparison words. </p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p>Do you ever make connections to things by just stating them instead of adding comparison words? For example, saying, “School is a prison,” or “They have a heart of gold,”. That’s a metaphor! You probably say around 6 metaphors a minute, depending on how quick you talk, and you probably don’t even notice it! Metaphors are so embedded in our language that we practically can't live without them. </p>
<div id="personification"><h2>Personification</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p><b>Personification</b> is a form of <b>figurative language</b> that occurs when <b>human characteristics</b> are applied to an <b>object</b> or <b>something nonhuman</b>, (<i>Refer to the examples</i>). It is like <b>anthropomorphism</b>, but anthropomorphism is only human characteristics applied to <b>animals</b>. </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>“This whole valley breathes and lives,” he said, sweeping his arm toward the distant mountains that guarded them. “It gives us the grapes and then they welcome us.” He gently touched a wild tendril that reached into the row, as if it had been waiting to shake his hand. He picked up a handful of earth and studied it. “Did you know that when you lie down on the land, you can feel it breathe? That you can feel its heart beating?” (<i>Pg. 1</i>) 
  <div></div>
    This is <b>personification</b> because it states how the "valley breathes and lives," giving the valley human traits and "they welcome us" this also gives inatimate objects human qualities.</p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p>Have you thought/felt as though your alarm clock was yelling at you when it goes off? That’s personification! Have you ever heard someone say something about food calling their name? That’s also personification! There are many ways personification is in your life, even right now!</p>
<div id="simile"><h2>Simile</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>A <b>simile</b> is a type of <b>figurative language</b> that directly <b>compares two things</b> by using <b>like or as</b>, (<i>see examples</i>). Similes are <b>different</b> from metaphors because of those <b>comparison words</b>, (<i>like, as, etc.</i>), metaphors only use <b>implicit</b> comparisons, (no comparison words). </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>“Then, like a caterpillar, she slowly inched flat next to him, their faces looking at each other.” (<i>Pg. 2</i>)
  <div></div>
  This is a <b>simile</b> because it compares her to a catipillar using the word "like".</p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p>Have you ever compared something by saying like or as? For example, “Did you see her? She ran like the wind!”. That’s a simile! You might be using similes in your everyday life without even noticing! Some more examples are, “She was as sly as a fox.” and “Watching that show was like watching paint dry.”.</p> 
<div id="symbolism"><h2>Symbolism</h2></div>
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p><b>Symbolism</b> is a type of <b>figurative language</b> that uses a <b>symbol</b>, <b>object</b>, or <b>word</b> to represent an <b>abstract idea</b>, (<i>see examples</i>). Symbolism <b>hints</b> at its <b>true meaning </b>instead of <b>blatantly</b> saying it’s meaning. Symbolism can also be used to <b>suggest moods</b> and <b>emotions</b>. </p>
  <h3>Example From Esperenza Rising</h3>
  <p>“Abuelita smiled, reached over, and pulled the yarn, unraveling all of Esperanza’s rows. “Do not be afraid to start over,” she said.” (<i>Pg. 15</i>) 
  <div></div>
  This is <b>symbolism</b> because it symbolizes a deeper meaning/a life lesson, (<i>Don’t be afraid to start over in life,</i>). </p>
  <h3>Real-world Example</h3>
  <p>People hint at people all the time using <b>symbolism</b> in real life! For example, white stands for life and purity and black usually stands for death. </p>
